Portfolio 1

This is an extension of the Lab 5 project. I added two components, one that subtracts two user inputted values and one that allows users to create a to do list. Using the components I created two new screens, a weight loss calculator and an exercise to do list. Users can add and delete items from the to do list as well as choose to only view the incomplete tasks.
